## Hi there 👋

I couldn't decide what username to choose since maxby is already taken. So, I tried out using gitub.com/max9my, hence it's already been my reddit nick for years ... 
however, my projects (well, it's really just one project due to my limited free time) is known to be publidhed by /BavarianMax, I thought I'd just reserve this name for if I decide to change it back later....
ok, bye
